# coin market-watcher
this is a tool that scrapes data hourly off from https://coinmarketcap.com/ without the use of proxies, it is a small project that I created for viewing certain coins on the market

# HOW IT WORKS?:
- this program works by sending a request every 1 hour to the website coinmarketcap.com, this is not the best way as it can get you rated limited sometimes but I highly doubt that since it just sending requests every hour
- made using beautiful soup to web scrape

- run the main file, main.py in order to start the program
- you can do whatever you want with the program, but everything you do is your own choice and I take no responsibility
